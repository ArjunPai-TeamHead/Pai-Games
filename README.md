# Alien Experiment: Survival & Discovery

A first-person 3D survival game where players wake up in a mysterious forest with no memory of how they arrived. Initially presented as a wilderness survival simulation, the game gradually reveals a deeper narrative about being subjects in an alien experiment.

## Game Overview

### Core Gameplay
- **Survival Mechanics**: Manage hunger, thirst, temperature, and energy
- **Resource Management**: Craft tools, build shelters, find food
- **Mystery Elements**: Discover the truth through environmental clues and anomalies
- **Narrative Choices**: Choose between following the experiment or rebelling
- **Multiple Endings**: Different outcomes based on player choices and performance

### Key Features
- Procedurally generated forest environment with subtle inconsistencies
- Day/night cycle with environmental effects
- AI wildlife with algorithmic behavioral patterns
- Progressive narrative reveal through environmental storytelling
- Inventory and crafting system
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Save system disguised as "synchronization points"

## Technical Stack
- **Engine**: Unity 3D
- **Graphics**: Low-poly stylized realism with dynamic color palette
- **Audio**: Ambient forest sounds with subtle electronic undertones
- **Platform**: PC (Windows, Mac, Linux)
